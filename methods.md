# Methods — RF-1 Soft-Soil Susceptibility (Maple Ridge, BC)

This document describes the methodology behind the geohazard demo: how the data is
ingested, how it is co-registered onto a common analysis grid, how the RF-1
soft-soil **Susceptibility (S)** and **Consequence (C)** ratings are derived, and how
they combine into a gold **risk matrix** (`risk_score = S × C`). It follows the
medallion architecture implemented across the seven Fabric notebooks
(`fabric/notebooks/`).

## 1. Study area (AOI)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Centre | Maple Ridge, BC — `49.2193° N, −122.5984° W` |
| Bronze query radius | 20 km (catalogue / regional context) |
| Silver analysis buffer | 3 km around the centre point |
| Analysis grid | 10 m, **UTM zone 10N (EPSG:32610)** |

The bronze layer catalogues sources over a generous 20 km radius so the demo can
show regional context. The silver/gold analysis clips to a deterministic
3 km × 3 km box to keep the per-pixel computation tractable while still covering the
populated valley floor.

---

## 2. Coordinate reference systems and projection handling

Two CRSs are used deliberately, each for the job it is suited to:

- **EPSG:4326 (WGS84 geographic, lat/lon)** — used for all *ingestion* queries: STAC
  bounding-box search against Microsoft Planetary Computer and OGC WFS `GetFeature`
  requests against DataBC. Raw geometries are stored in 4326 in the bronze layer.
- **EPSG:32610 (UTM 10N, metric)** — used for all *analysis*: the silver grid is built
  in UTM so that distances, slopes and pixel areas are in metres and every raster
  source can be co-registered pixel-for-pixel. UTM zone 10N (126°W–120°W) covers
  southwestern British Columbia, including the AOI.

### 2.1 AOI bounding box from a radius

`radius_to_bbox(lat, lon, radius_km)` converts a kilometre radius to degree offsets
using an equirectangular approximation:

```
lat_delta = radius_km / 111.32
lon_delta = radius_km / (111.32 · cos(lat))
bbox = [lon − lon_delta, lat − lat_delta, lon + lon_delta, lat + lat_delta]
       # → [min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat]
```

The `cos(lat)` term corrects for meridian convergence so the box is roughly square on
the ground. This planar approximation is appropriate for a catalogue-scale bbox.

### 2.2 WFS axis-order handling (the subtle part)

OGC WFS 2.0.0 honours the *authority-defined* axis order. For the URN form
`urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326`, EPSG defines the axis order as **(latitude, longitude)** —
**not** lon/lat. The DataBC bronze notebooks emit the bbox accordingly:

```python
BBOX_PARAM = f"{BBOX[1]},{BBOX[0]},{BBOX[3]},{BBOX[2]},urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326"
#             min_lat , min_lon , max_lat , max_lon , CRS-urn
```

`srsName=EPSG:4326` is also requested so returned geometries come back as lat/lon
GeoJSON. Getting this axis order wrong is the most common cause of "empty" or
"off-by-a-continent" WFS results; this is handled explicitly.

### 2.3 Always-XY transforms

All `pyproj.Transformer` instances are created with `always_xy=True`, so every
transform consumes and produces coordinates in **(x=lon/easting, y=lat/northing)**
order regardless of the CRS's native axis convention. This keeps the silver code
free of axis-order ambiguity.

## 3. Bronze layer — raw ingestion

The bronze layer stores raw source records (no analytics) as Delta tables in
`bronze_lakehouse`. Two source families:

### 3.1 Microsoft Planetary Computer (STAC metadata)

`bronze_pc_collections.ipynb` catalogues seven collections over the AOI bbox by
POSTing to the Planetary Computer STAC search API. Each row is a STAC **item record**
(id, datetime, asset hrefs, and the item bbox `bbox_minx/miny/maxx/maxy`) — the
pixels themselves are pulled later, on demand, in silver.

| Collection | Role in RF-1 |
|---|---|
| `sentinel-2-l2a` | optical surface reflectance → spectral indices |
| `sentinel-1-rtc` | C-band SAR → radar wetness |
| `cop-dem-glo-30` | 30 m DEM → slope, valley-bottom flatness |
| `esa-worldcover` | land cover → wetland/water flags, exposure |
| `io-lulc-9-class` | land use/land cover context |
| `alos-palsar-mosaic` | L-band SAR context |
| `hgb` | above/below-ground biomass context |

Sentinel-2 is filtered to the snow-free growing season (2024-06-01 / 2024-09-30) with
`eo:cloud_cover < 30`. The search retries bbox-only if a property-filtered search
returns nothing, so the demo degrades gracefully.

`bronze_planetary_ingestion.ipynb` is a simpler single-collection, parameterised
variant (Sentinel-2 only, append mode) kept for the CI/CD promotion demo.

### 3.2 DataBC WFS (vector ground truth)

Vector layers are fetched as GeoJSON over plain HTTP from the BC Geographic Warehouse
WFS (`https://openmaps.gov.bc.ca/geo/pub/wfs`), clipped to the AOI bbox, and stored
with `geometry_json` + `properties_json` preserved verbatim.

| Notebook | Bronze tables | Source layers |
|---|---|---|
| `bronze_bc_surficial_geology.ipynb` | `bronze_bc_quaternary_geology`, `bronze_bc_bedrock_geology`, `bronze_bc_geological_faults` | surficial/bedrock geology, fault lines |
| `bronze_bc_soil_survey.ipynb` | `bronze_bc_soil_survey_polygons`, `bronze_bc_soil_project_boundaries` | BC Soil Information Finder Tool (SIFT) |

`bronze_data_overview.ipynb` is a read-only inspector: it lists every bronze table,
reports row/column counts, and renders each layer on its own folium map (live
Planetary Computer raster tiles for STAC tables, real GeoJSON for vector tables) with
click-through "every column" popups. No projection logic — folium consumes WGS84
directly.

---

## 4. Silver layer — RF-1 factor metrics + S/C ratings

`silver_rf1_soil_susceptibility.ipynb` produces one row per 10 m pixel.

### 4.1 Deterministic analysis grid

The centre point is projected to UTM, buffered by 3 km, and snapped to the 10 m grid
so the box is reproducible run-to-run:

```python
cx, cy = to_utm.transform(LON, LAT)          # always_xy → (easting, northing)
half_m = 3.0 * 1000
minx   = floor((cx − half_m) / 10) · 10      # snap origin to the 10 m grid
maxy   = ceil ((cy + half_m) / 10) · 10
W = H  = round(2 · half_m / 10)              # ~600 × 600 px
GEOBOX = GeoBox((H, W), Affine(10, 0, minx, 0, −10, maxy), "EPSG:32610")
```

The affine is standard north-up (positive x-step, negative y-step from the top-left
origin). The WGS84 search bbox is recovered by inverse-transforming the grid corners,
so the STAC search and the grid are guaranteed consistent.

### 4.2 Raster co-registration

Every raster source is searched on Planetary Computer over the 3 km bbox, signed, and
loaded with `odc.stac.load(items, geobox=GEOBOX, resampling=…)`. Because all sources
load onto the **same GeoBox**, they are reprojected and resampled to the identical
10 m UTM grid in one step and stack cleanly — no manual alignment. Bilinear resampling
is used for continuous rasters (reflectance, DEM, SAR); nearest for categorical
(WorldCover). Multi-date stacks are reduced with a skipna median.

### 4.3 Factor metrics

| Metric | Definition | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| NDVI | (B08 − B04)/(B08 + B04) | vegetation |
| NDWI | (B03 − B08)/(B03 + B08) | open water (McFeeters) |
| BSI | ((B11+B04) − (B08+B02)) / ((B11+B04) + (B08+B02)) | bare soil |
| organic_idx | B11 / B12 (SWIR1/SWIR2) | organic-soil proxy |
| slope_deg | `degrees(arctan(hypot(∇z)))`, `∇z` from `np.gradient(z, 10, 10)` | steepness (metres → degrees, valid because the grid is metric) |
| vbf_proxy | flatness × lowness (MrVBF-style) | valley-bottom flatness |
| vv_db / vh_db | `10·log10(linear power)` | SAR backscatter / wetness |
| worldcover_class | ESA WorldCover code | land cover |

### 4.4 Soil-survey ground truth (BC SIFT)

The satellite/DEM/radar metrics are *indirect* proxies. The BC soil-survey polygons
are surveyed ground truth, so they get the largest single weight. Each polygon is
reprojected to UTM with `rasterio.warp.transform_geom("EPSG:4326", "EPSG:32610", geom)`
and **rasterized onto the same (H, W) grid using `GEOBOX.affine`**. A keyword score maps
drainage/parent-material/texture text to a soft-soil weight (organic / very-poorly-
drained / gley → 1.0; fluvial / lacustrine / clay → ~0.7; mapped-but-unknown → 0.4).
The signal degrades to all-zero if the soil table is absent.

### 4.5 Susceptibility (S) and Consequence (C)

A soft-soil probability `P ∈ [0,1]` is an availability-weighted blend:

```
P = 0.25·vbf + 0.20·soil + 0.15·(wetland/water) + 0.13·wet_radar
  + 0.12·wet_ndwi + 0.08·bare + 0.07·organic
```

Surveyed organic / very-poorly-drained ground forces `P ≥ 0.85`. `P` is binned to
**S ∈ {1..5}** at thresholds `[0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80]`, with hard overrides: wetland +
VV < −15 dB → 5; open water → 5; surveyed soft soil → at least 4.

**C ∈ {1..5}** is an exposure proxy from WorldCover (built-up → 5, cropland → 4,
grass/shrub → 2–3, water/bare → 1), bumped +1 where slope > 15° (movement matters more
on slopes). Pixel centres are converted back to lon/lat via the inverse UTM transform
and stored alongside `utm_x/utm_y` for downstream mapping.

## 5. Gold layer — RF-1 risk matrix

`gold_rf1_risk_matrix.ipynb` reads the silver table and computes:

```
risk_score = S × C            # 1..25
band: Low 1–4 · Moderate 5–9 · High 10–19 · Extreme 20–25
```

Three Delta tables are written:

| Table | Grain | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `gold_rf1_risk_pixels` | per 10 m pixel | S, C, risk_score, band, coordinates |
| `gold_rf1_risk_matrix` | per S×C cell (≤ 25 rows) | pixel_count, mean_risk, risk_score, band |
| `gold_rf1_band_summary` | per risk band | pixel_count, area_km² (`pixel_count × 10²/10⁶`), pct |

The notebook closes with a three-panel figure: the coloured 5×5 S×C matrix with pixel
counts, the spatial risk map over the AOI (10 m), and area-by-band bars.

---

## 6. Reproducibility notes

- **Determinism** — the UTM grid origin is snapped to the 10 m grid and the STAC bbox is
  derived from the grid corners, so re-runs produce the identical grid and the same
  pixels.
- **Cross-lakehouse reads** — silver and gold read upstream Delta tables by explicit
  `abfss://…/Tables` paths (workspace/lakehouse GUIDs), so each notebook can run with its
  own default lakehouse attached.
- **Season** — indices and radar use the 2024 snow-free window (Jun–Sep) to avoid snow
  and low-sun artefacts.
- **Graceful degradation** — missing optional sources (e.g. the soil table) collapse to a
  zero signal rather than failing the run.
